# Codes (Readme File)

Welcome to Codes Repository! This repository is a collection of Python programs covering a wide range of topics, from number theory to string manipulation


## Installation

You must have Python 3.x installed on your computer to use this project. Python can be downloaded from the official website.

Once Python is installed, you can either download the zip file directly from GitHub or use Git to clone the repository to your local computer.

The repository is organized into several sections, each containing Python programs on different topics:

# 1. Number Theory
Explore mathematical concepts with these programs.

divisible_by_7.py: Find numbers divisible by 7 but not multiples of 5 between 2000 and 3200.
sum_of_factorials.py: Calculate the sum of the series 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ... + 1/N!.
# 2. Series and Trigonometry
Dive into mathematical series and trigonometric functions.

sine_series.py: Implement the sine series expansion.
cosine_series.py: Calculate the cosine series expansion.
# 3. Numbers and Strings
Explore operations on numbers and strings.

armstrong_number.py: Identify Armstrong numbers.
count_letters_digits.py: Calculate the number of letters and digits in a string.
non_prime_numbers.py: Display numbers that are not prime.
# 4. Password Validation
Enhance security with password validation.

password_validation.py: Check the validity of passwords input by users.
# 5. Mathematical Computations
Perform mathematical computations with these programs.

lcm.py: Find the least common multiple of two numbers.
gcd.py: Calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers with and without recursion.
# 6. Dictionaries
Explore dictionary operations.

check_dictionary_key.py: Check if a key exists in a dictionary.
create_dictionary.py: Create a dictionary where keys are the first characters and values are words starting with that character.
